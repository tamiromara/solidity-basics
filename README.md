# Solidity Basics

Welcome to the **Solidity Basics** repository! This is part of my **#90DaysOfSolidity** learning journey, where I will be uploading code on a daily basis as I learn and practice Solidity, the programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
## About This Journey
- **Duration**: 90 days of consistent learning and coding
- **Goal**: To develop a deep understanding of Solidity and blockchain development in general
- **Daily Updates**: I will post my code here daily as part of this journey.
- **Weekly blog posts**: this is optional for now, but i'll do my best to at least post once every two weeks.
## Topics Covered
Over the course of this journey, I will be exploring:
- Basic syntax and structure of Solidity
- Writing and deploying smart contracts
- Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
- Gas optimization techniques
- Security best practices for smart contracts
- Advanced Solidity features (Inheritance, Libraries, etc.)
- This section is dynamic and will keep changing
## How to Use
Feel free to explore each day's code in the respective folders. If you're new to Solidity, you can follow along with the journey by reviewing the code and trying the exercises yourself.
I'm currently consuming Cyfrin Foundry learning materials on blockchain and solidity. [@PatrickAlphaC](https://github.com/patrickalphac) and the rest of the team at Cyfrin Updraft are doing an amazing job providing this sort of quality materials free of charge for the community. 
Please have a look at Cyfrin Updraft page on Githut here. You can also check their interactive learning platform at [updraft.cyfrin.io](https://updraft.cyfrin.io)
